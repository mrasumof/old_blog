I am an IT professional with 20 years of professional experience. I have been lucky to get exposure to a wide variety of roles within IT, ranging from system analyst, software developer, passing through data networking and leading a team of more than 100 people to replace a very complex commercial system for my last employer in the healthcare field. I am curious to an extreme. I need to understand why things are the way they are.I am not ashamed of defying the Status-quo, trait that sometimes cause me some trouble :smile:
