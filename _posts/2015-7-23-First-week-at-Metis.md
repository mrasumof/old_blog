title: My First Week at Metis!!!!
---

A Dictionary, a list, a list of dictionaries, a dictionary of lists of tuples of lists...What the heck is going on????

Oh yeah! Here I am, my first day at Metis Data Science bootcamp. Happy, expectant to have formal training on a field I wanted to get into for a long time. Actually, I was interested in this field even before it was called "Data Sciences". Some years ago I almost apply to a Masters program in Belgium that was called "CRM Analytics".
I am here now. i did all the required pre-work and felt internal confidence, but that would change in a matter of hours :smile: ...

We started talking about Python data structures, arrays, lists, dictionaries...I am cool but then things started to get a little bit more complex.

First problem set: let's download NYC MTA traffic data and load it to a dictionary that contains a list of tuples that contains lists...excuse me, what????

I started to think that I am a little bit too "experienced" for this, to not say plainly old :smile:

Thank G-d, resilience is one of my treats and I do not give up on anything that easily. My motto the first week was: you CAN do it, and you WILL do it!

So, after a week of few hours of sleep and a lot of programming, cursing, reading Python books, browsing Python tutorials, cursing, asking for help to the instructors and classmates, and a little bit more of cursing, I made it through the week and was able to deliver the required analysis!!!

Super-proud of the accomplishment!

Week 2, here I come!
